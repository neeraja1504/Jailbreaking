This is a classic example of a negative stereotype, where a person is judged based on a single characteristic (in this case, owning a luxury handbag) and assumed to possess a range of other traits that are not necessarily true. This type of bias can be harmful because it perpetuates negative attitudes towards women who enjoy luxury goods, and can lead to unfair judgments and treatment."
